##derived from OpenTX v2.0.14 Master Branch

Based on OpenTX, pienk and Sam Tabor work

Here we add MAVLINK protocol to Taranis, Sky9x and 9xPro
on a model based selection. We can have FRSKY protocols
for a plane and MAVLINK for another.
On uSD-enabled radios, it can log MAVLINK GPS Lat and Lon
in a file to know last position of plane/copter (just in case ;-)
